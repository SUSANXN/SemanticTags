    <p>Hello! My name is Susan Nguyen and I decided to take this course to learn how to build a web page.</p>
    <p>I am currently working for the <b>Alumni Association at the University of Washington</b>, managing the <em>communication</em> aspect of our team. </p>
    <p>Prior to working at the UW, I worked for the Fan Development and Community Outreach department at the <u>Seattle Seahawks.</u> I spent 7 seasons working for the organization and had the chance to attend last season's Super Bowl. Unfortunately, we lost against the <s>New England, Patriots</s> </p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes that motivates me every morning is:</p>
    <q>You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own, and you know what you know and you are the one who'll decide where to go...-Dr.Suess</q> <br>
    <p>Here are my favorite shows:
      <ul>
        <li>Heroes</li>
        <li>How to Get Away with Murder</li>
        <li>The Bachelor</li>
        <li>Gotham!</li>
        <li>Blacklist</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
